## Modules

The SOAR framework includes the following modules:

| **Sr. No.** | **Modules**   |
| ----------- | ------------- |
| 1           | Alerts        |
| 2           | Announcements |
| 3           | Assets        |
| 4           | Campaigns     |
| 5           | Communication |
| 6           | Events        |
| 7           | Hunt          |
| 8           | Incidents     |
| 9           | Indicators    |
| 10          | SLA Template  |
| 11          | War Rooms     |

## Alerts

Alerts are primary actionable data elements that we obtain through a periodic ingestion process. We extract data through multiple channels like emails, SIEM platforms, or EDR platforms to create alerts. Once we have alerts, multiple playbooks are launched to extract and enrich the indicators.

To enhance or extend this default schema, refer to section [Extending Default Alert Schema](#extending-default-alert-schema).

## Announcements

The announcements module helps notify users who are a part of a [war room](#war-rooms). 

## Assets

Assets represent a unique piece of hardware and any information known about that hardware, such as MAC address, hostname, or IP address. Assets preferably have a unique identifier. The assets module helps add devices within FortiSOAR for use by the SOC team. Computers typically represent the assets of your organization. 

## Campaigns

Campaigns are a collection of incidents relatable to a single threat actor. Many times, disparate incidents are connected attempts of a malicious attacker attempting to probe and gain access to a network.

## Communication

It helps users to communicate with external entities like tenant contacts, and other SOC teams, using email, instant messaging (IM), etc. from within an alert generated in FortiSOAR. For this purpose, it uses IMAP and Exchange connectors.

## Events

Events consist of records that contain machine-level information about activity that triggered a specific alert.

## Hunt

The Hunts module is a place to store and organize your hunts. The hunt you create here will be the central repository where all Alerts, Assets, Users, and other modules’ records that become associated with your hunting activity will be linked together. 

## Incidents

Incidents are confirmed alerts that negatively affect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of an organization. Incidents represent a collection of information discovered during an Incident Response investigation. Incidents are triggered based on the suspicion or confirmation of a security breach.

## Indicators

**Indicators of compromise** (IOCs) serve as evidence of probable intrusions on a host system or network. These artifacts help personnel at a Security Operations Center (SOC) to detect intrusion attempts or other malicious activities. IOCs help better analyze a particular malware’s techniques and behaviors and provide actionable threat intelligence to further improve an organization’s incident response strategies.

Some of this evidence of potential breach is found on event logs and timestamped entries in the system, applications, and services.

## SLA Template

SLA Templates in FortiSOAR help create an in-built SLA management for incidents and alerts. For more information, please refer to [SLA Management](https://docs.fortinet.com/document/fortisoar/7.0.2/administration-guide/792686/sla-management). 

## War Rooms

War Rooms in FortiSOAR is a collaborative space that enables SOC teams to mitigate a critical cyber threat scenario or campaign. FortiSOAR makes it easy for analysts to quickly and easily provision a War Room that allows participation of all stakeholders to analyze and collaborate to quickly mitigate the threat and restore the services. For more information, see the War Rooms chapter.

## Naming Convention

Playbooks follow a specific order of execution and are arranged in the same sequence as the flow of alert ingestion in the SOAR Framework. Hence the name carries a number that defines the order in which the playbooks run.

## Rules

Rules provide a framework to define a condition that generates notifications.

The SOAR Framework includes the following rules:

- Alert > Notify Creation - It sends a notification, via the app or the email, whenever an alert is **created**.
- Alert > Notify Update - It sends a notification, via the app or the email, whenever an alert is **updated**.
- Incident > Notify Creation - It sends a notification, via the app or the email, whenever an incident is **created**.
- Incident > Notify Update - It sends a notification, via the app or the email, whenever an incident is **updated**.

## Widgets

Widgets render information for the visual display inside View Template. Widget types vary such that specific widgets only correspond to certain view types. For example, the detail view has some exclusive widgets, such as Visual Correlation, Comments, Timeline, etc.

SOAR Framework has the following widgets:

| **Widgets**                | Description                              |
| -------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| Task Management (War Room) | It is a comprehensive task management widget that helps users manage tasks and get visibility into the current task board. |
| Record Summary (War Room)  | It is primarily designed to showcase a particular record's highlights or summary, this widget houses multiple utility widgets within it to allow for customized uses. |
| SLA Count Down Timer       | This widget displays the remaining time for an SLA. |
| User Tile                  | This widget shows relevant information like alerts, incidents, and tasks to users. |

| Incident Timeline          | This widget displays a vertical timeline showing an Incident record's correlated Alerts and Indicators, sorted based on user-selectable date fields. |


## Roles

SOAR framework has the following roles included:

- SOC Analyst
- SOC Manager
- Full app permissions

## Dashboards

A Dashboard is the default landing page, and users' home page, that users see when they log into FortiSOAR. Dashboard, at a glance, shows them the critical tasks on which they need to work. SOAR Framework includes the following dashboards:

| **Sr. No.** | **Dashboards** | **Description** |
| ----------- | -------------- | --------------- |

## Enrich Playbook Collection

It has two playbook collections

- 03 - Enrich
- 03 - Enrich (Pluggable)

### 03 - Enrich

Playbooks in the *03-Enrich* collection help perform enrichment of data -- one of the first incident response tasks. Automating data enrichment tasks helps better manage increasing volumes of threats and provides more actionable context to the analysts. An example of an enrichment type playbook would be retrieving the reputation of a file, domain, URL, etc. from threat intelligence platforms such as Anomali ThreatStream and VirusTotal.

Following is a table that lists the playbooks that are part of the *“03-Enrich”*collection in the Solution Pack:

In the standard *Enrich* playbook, all threat intelligence platforms for a particular indicator type are configured in a single playbook. In *Enrich (Pluggable)* collection, every threat intelligence platform for a particular indicator type has a separate playbook, which can be plugged in or referenced to the enrichment playbook.
