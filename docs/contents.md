|---------|---------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1       | Alerts        | Alerts are primary actionable data elements that we obtain through a periodic ingestion process. We extract data through multiple channels like emails, SIEM platforms, or EDR platforms to create alerts. Once we have alerts, multiple playbooks are launched to extract and enrich the indicators.<br/><br/>To enhance or extend this default schema, refer to section [Extending Default Alert Schema](./extending-default-alert-schema.md).                                                                                                                               |

| 7       | Hunt          | The Hunts module is a place to store and organize your hunts. The hunt you create here will be the central repository where all Alerts, Assets, Users, and other modules’ records that become associated with your hunting activity will be linked together.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 8       | Incidents     | Incidents are confirmed alerts that negatively affect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of an organization. Incidents represent a collection of information discovered during an Incident Response investigation. Incidents are triggered based on the suspicion or confirmation of a security breach.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 9       | Indicators    | **Indicators of compromise** (IOCs) serve as evidence of probable intrusions on a host system or network. These artifacts help personnel at a Security Operations Center (SOC) to detect intrusion attempts or other malicious activities. IOCs help better analyze a particular malware’s techniques and behaviors and provide actionable threat intelligence to further improve an organization’s incident response strategies.<br/><br/>Some of this evidence of potential breach is found on event logs and timestamped entries in the system, applications, and services. |

## Playbook Collection

SOAR Framework includes the following playbook collections:

- 01 – Drafts
- 02 - Use Cases
- 03 – Enrich
- 03 – Triage
- 04 – Actions
- 05 – Hunt
- 06 - IRP - Case Management
- 06 - IRP - Communications Tracking
- 06 - IRP – Reporting
- 06 - IRP - War Room
- 07 - Incident Response Plan
- 08 – Utilities

## Naming Convention

Playbooks follow a specific order of execution and are arranged in the same sequence as the flow of alert ingestion in the SOAR Framework. Hence the name carries a number that defines the order in which the playbooks run.

## Enrich Playbook Collection

Playbooks in the *03-Enrich* collection help perform enrichment of data &ndash; one of the first incident response tasks. Automating data enrichment tasks helps better manage increasing volumes of threats and provides more actionable context to the analysts. An example of an enrichment type playbook would be retrieving the reputation of a file, domain, URL, etc. from threat intelligence platforms such as Anomali ThreatStream and VirusTotal.
