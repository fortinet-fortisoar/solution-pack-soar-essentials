>**NOTE**: After updating the connectors to the stated version if the enrichment summary is not available on an indicator, you may have to:
> 1. Execute **Reset Enrichment Global Variables** playbook from **03 â€“ Enrich** collection to delete the following global variables:
>     - `URL_Enrichment_Playbooks_IRIs`
>     - `File_Enrichment_Playbooks_IRIs`
>     - `IP_Enrichment_Playbooks_IRIs`
>     - `Domain_Enrichment_Playbooks_IRIs`
>     - `FileHash_Enrichment_Playbooks_IRIs`
>     - `User_Enrichment_Playbooks_IRIs`
>     - `Email_Enrichment_Playbooks_IRIs`
> 2. Force the sync with FortiSOAR Content Hub servers. Execute the following commands on the FortiSOAR command line interface (CLI) to re-sync.
>     ```bash
>     sudo -u nginx php /opt/cyops-api/bin/console fortisoar:contenthub:sync -fs
>     ```

>**NOTE**: For users, upgrading to 2.0.2 from previous versions, json validators may give an error while validating the contents of `Indicator_Type_Map` global variable. This error is due to the presence of a duplicate key-value pair `"parentProcessName": "Process"`. As a workaround, you may remove this extra key-value pair with no impact to your environment.
