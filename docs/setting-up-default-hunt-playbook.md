# Setting up Default Hunt Playbook

Threat hunt focusses on detecting the most sophisticated threats as early as possible to minimize the impact of a breach. Using threat hunting playbooks, you can not only hunt for indicators in real time, but can also perform retrospective detection to determine if the organization was in fact compromised in the past and, if so, immediately launch the incident response process.
