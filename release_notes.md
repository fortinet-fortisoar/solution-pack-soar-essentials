        <td>Before updating the SOAR Framework solution pack, make sure to back up any modifications you have made to <strong>System View Templates (SVTs)</strong>, <strong>Module Metadata (MMD)</strong>, and <strong>Playbooks</strong>. This is essential because updating the solution pack overwrites any changes you might have made.</td>
